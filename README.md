# SysBotRemote

SysBotRemote is a robust application that enables users to automate button presses on their Nintendo Switch consoles remotely. With support for multiple switches at once, SysBotRemote is a powerful tool that can aid in automating in-game actions, testing, and more. The application includes features for recording sequences of button presses (macros) and playing them back, as well as a live mode that enables the application to function as a remote controller.

## Features

1. **Macro Recording and Playback**: SysBotRemote allows users to record sequences of button presses, store them as macros, and play them back at will. This feature is ideal for automating repetitive in-game tasks, testing game functionality, or even simulating player interactions.

2. **Multiple Switch Support**: SysBotRemote can interact with multiple Nintendo Switch consoles simultaneously. Whether you're synchronizing actions across multiple games or conducting large-scale tests, SysBotRemote has you covered.

3. **Live Mode**: In Live Mode, SysBotRemote transforms into a remote controller for your Nintendo Switch console. Every button press in the application is sent in real-time to all selected switches, allowing for live interaction and control.
